We'll denote our input variable as $x$ and the variable we are trying to predict as $y$ (because [that's what Descartes did in 1637](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2936/why-are-x-and-y-such-common-variables-in-todays-equations-how-did-their-use-or/)). We'll call the guess generated by our model $\\hat{y}$. We will auspiciously call our errors $\\epsilon$ (pronounced \"epp-sih-lawn\"), since we hope for them to be small, and $\\epsilon$ is the traditional symbol for \"very small, but not 0\". Our errors are random (or else we'd try to predict them!) and so they have a probability distribution, $p(\\epsilon)$. When we want to say some random number is distributed according to some distribution, we write $x \\sim p(x)$.\n",

The most common version is a fancy (aka \"script\") N: $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma)$ for a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma$. Combining our assumption with our new notation, we can rewrite our equations:\n",

Below, we'll visualize this distribution. Also, notice that, once we pick a distribution for our errors, changing $f$ is the only way we can change our model. Below, we'll also visualize some common choices for $f$."

    "Linear models won't always describe our data well. Linearized models are one popular alternative to linear models that retains most of the good features of linear models (easy to fit and write down, amenable to fast matrix multiplication) while avoiding the difficulties that plague truly non-linear models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a linearized model, we use the exact same trick that we used in order to be able to change the $y$-intercept of our linear model. We *transform* our data using a non-linear transformation and then treat the transformed data as just another dimension of our data. Another way to say this is that we add it to our matrix of `X` values as another regressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy functions are super useful for implementing linearized models. This is because applying a numpy function like `np.square` or `np.cos` to a numpy array returns an array containing that function applied to each element of the original array. For example, when `x` is an array, `np.cos(x)` returns the same thing as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "y = np.zeros(len(x))\n",
    "for idx in enumerate(x):\n",
    "    y[idx] = math.cos(x[idx])\n",
    "```\n",
    "with a lot less typing!\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, use `np.square` to add a regressor equal to $x^2$ to the `X` matrix, compute the predicted values `y_hat` using the provided weights `w`, and plot `y_hat` as a function of `x` using `plotModel`."

Start this value off at 7, and then increase it to 11, 17, and 25. Notice how the modeling function gets closer and closer something we don't usually think of as a polynomial -- the sine function!

Examples you've seen already include $\\mathrm{sin}(\\theta*x)$ and $\\mathrm{e}^{\\theta * x}$, where $g$ is $sin$ and $\\mathrm{exp}$. These are called *linear-nonlinear* models. You can make your own if you'd like! You can change the minimum and maximum values for the inputs $x$ and parameter $\\theta$ by changing the values in the lists passed to `setupLN`."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Our models so far have been *parametric* models, since they included a small number of parameters, vectors of $w$ or $\\theta$. For the models we've considered so far, this has severely limited the kinds of relationships our functions have been able to capture. The technical way of saying this is that it has limited the *expressivity* of our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to fix this is by attacking it directly: improving the expressivity of the nonlinear functions in our parametric models. We used simple functions, like the trigonometric functions and exponential functions, but these turn out to be bad choices for expressivity. By trial and error, the field of machine learning has stumbled upon *neural networks* as a good choice. In a neural network, multiple linear-nonlinear functions are chained together, one after the other. For reasons that are still under research, this is a fabulous way to get tremendous expressivity out of small numbers of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't spend a ton of time on neural networks in this class, so if you'd like to see those models in action, check out Google's [Neural Network Playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The other way to fix this is by using the dataset as the parameters of the model. That is, we try to come up with a clever function $f(x,D)$, where $D$ is the entire dataset, that does a good job predicting $y$. Because the model depends directly on the data, and not on any parameters, we call these models *non-parametric* models. Non-parametric models are able to model any relationship between variables, but they're usually computationally expensive to fit and to get predictions out of, and they have worse performance on data that is actually generated by a parametric model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This should remind you of the non-parametric statistical methods we've discussed, like the bootstrap. In the bootstrap, the model of our data was the data itself, through its empirical CDF. The empirical CDF, unlike the mean or the variance, gets harder to describe as we get more data: to write down an empirical CDF, you need to know the location of each \"step\" in the function -- of each data point -- while to know the mean or variance you only need one number. Bootstrap models were also more computationally expensive and performed worse on models that came from parametric distributions."

    "### Defining \"Non-Parametric\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Some folks, like Kendrick Kay, like to lump neural networks in with non-parametric models. For them, the key property of non-parametric models is that they solve our expressivity problem and, relatedly, don't make strong assumptions about the kinds of relationships that might be in the data. Non-parametric models and neural networks are similar in this regard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though I understand where this perspective is coming from, I think it's somewhat confusing, especially since polynomial models can also be very expressive, especially when they have as many degrees as neural networks have parameters (in the tens, if not hundreds, of thousands!). It's also absolutely the case that neural networks have parameters, so folks like Kendrick find themselves in the awkward position of having a \"non-parametric\" model that has parameters!"

    "In local regression, we fit a different model at each x-value (not just at each datapoint), and then combine them together. The most common model is called *LOWESS*, for **LO**cally **WE**ighted **S**catterplot **S**moothing. It's a local regression model and can be thought of as a smoother version of nearest-neighbor regression, hence the first, third, and fourth words in its name. At each possible value for $x$, we fit a (possibly linear) regression model to the nearest datapoints, with more emphasis on the datapoints that have the the most similar $x$ values. Mathematically, the emphasis shows up as a *weight* that increases or decreases the contribution of data points to each model, explaining the second term in the method's name."
