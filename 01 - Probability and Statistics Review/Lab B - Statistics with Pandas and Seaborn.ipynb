    "\n",
    "One common goal we have when calculating statistics is to *describe* the data. This is called, sensibly enough, *descriptive statistics*. In the field of statistics, we study the properties of these descriptions: which datasets do they summarize well? when does a difference in a statistic mean the datasets are different? how can I tell whether one statistic or another is a better summary of the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is *understanding* data -- being able to build models that describe it well or being able to predict the behavior of a system well enough to control it (e.g. to fix it when it is broken, as in medicine).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get our hands on some statistics, we first need a dataset. We'll be working with two. For concreteness' sake, let's say one represents the number of spikes produced by a neuron in response to repeated presentations of some stimulus and the other represents the reaction times of a subject during a cognitive task."
