    "The word *statistic* is ultimately derived from an expression that means *arithmetic of the state*. Historically, the entities organized enough and large enough to collect information at a scale that necessitated statistical methods were states -- in war, as [related by Thucydides in the 5th Century BC](https://books.google.com/books?id=yA6rCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26), in taxation, and in census-taking. This history has left its mark on the words we use to describe statistical problems to this very day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of probability and statistics in applications is almost always *inference* -- drawing conclusions from limited data. In the endeavors of states, the problem of inference usually looks something like this: there is a collection of entities, be they subjects, soldiers, parcels of land, or units of goods. We call this collection the *population*. Each member of the population has an associated number or numbers: age, pay, crop yield, and weight, for example. These are called *random variables*, since they vary from individual to individual. There is a quantity summarizes the values of these random variables in the population, just as we had quantities to summarize our datasets in the previous labs. We call this quantity a *parameter* of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters are of great utility: we could use the variance of the crop yields to predict the variance of tax revenue across the country, or we could use the fraction of our subjects who are working-age males to predict how large an army we could conscript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, collecting the actual values of these parameters is prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and/or invasive, since we need to measure the data of interest for every member of the population -- the age of every man in France or the yield of every parcel of land in Northern Italy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we collect a *random sample* from the population -- a subgroup of individuals, chosen at random -- and then we measure their associated data values. In the simplest case, we then calculate the parameter on this random sample (the average, the fraction that are between a certain value, etc.) and use this as a guess for, an estimate of, the true value of the parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the value we calculate isn't always correct -- in fact, it should be different *every time we measure it*, since we choose our subgroup randomly each time -- but for many parameters we know that the value we estimate from taking random samples will, on average, be the correct value. Furthermore, thanks to a classic theorem of statistics known as the [*Law of Large Numbers*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), we know that, if our sample is large enough, the variability of our estimate around this average will go down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics is now often used in cases where there isn't an obvious \"large population\" that we \"draw samples from\". For example, our experiment may involve creating a genetic line of mice, measuring properties of every single mouse (often less than 10) and then inferring what the values of those properties would be if we were to keep generating more mice. Because of this, the term \"sample\" has somewhat fallen out of use outside of statistics proper, in favor of the term \"dataset\". However, the classical application of statistics to measuring extant populations of individuals via random sampling has given us the vocabulary that we use to describe our statistical procedures and the intellectual framework that we use to explain and motivate our inferences."

For example, we calculate the maximum of the sample to estimate the maximum of the population.\n",

    "If we estimate this center with the median or with the mean, the average value of our estimate, averaged over possible samples, is equal to the value of the center. An estimator that has this property is called an *unbiased* estimator. In some cases, an unbiased estimator for a parameter doesn't exist (we'll encounter this later, when we come to estimating model performance). Perhaps more surprisingly, there are often situations where the plug-in estimator is biased, and sitations where a biased estimator is a good choice. We'll be focusing on unbiased estimators for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if we restrict ourselves to unbiased estimators, we can think of estimators other than the sample mean or median. We could, for example, also take a sample, throw out all except the third number, and use that as our estimate for the center. This will also be an unbiased estimator -- averaged over possible samples, the average value of the third number is just the mean, which is the location of the center.\n",
