We often think of our guess as an *estimate*, and so the guess is called an *estimator*. After establishing the vocabulary of inference, we will work through an example of using different estimators to guess the same value. Then, we'll use a special statistic called a *confidence interval* to describe our uncertainty about the quality of our guess."

    "The word *statistic* is ultimately derived from an expression that means *arithmetic of the state*. Historically, the entities organized enough and large enough to collect information at a scale that necessitated statistical methods were states -- in war, as [related by Thucydides in the 5th Century BC](https://books.google.com/books?id=yA6rCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26), in taxation, and in census-taking. This history has left its mark on the words we use to describe statistical problems to this very day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of probability and statistics in applications is almost always *inference* -- drawing conclusions from limited data. In the endeavors of states, the problem of inference usually looks something like this: there is a collection of entities, be they subjects, soldiers, parcels of land, or units of goods. We call this collection the *population*. Each member of the population has an associated number or numbers: age, pay, crop yield, and weight, for example. These are called *random variables*, since they vary from individual to individual. There is a quantity summarizes the values of these random variables in the population, just as we had quantities to summarize our datasets in the previous labs. We call this quantity a *parameter* of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters are of great utility: we could use the variance of the crop yields to predict the variance of tax revenue across the country, or we could use the fraction of our subjects who are working-age males to predict how large an army we could conscript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, collecting the actual values of these parameters is prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and/or invasive, since we need to measure the data of interest for every member of the population -- the age of every man in France or the yield of every parcel of land in Northern Italy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we collect a *random sample* from the population -- a subgroup of individuals, chosen at random -- and then we measure their associated data values. In the simplest case, we then calculate the parameter on this random sample (the average, the fraction that are between a certain value, etc.) and use this as a guess for, an estimate of, the true value of the parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the value we calculate isn't always correct -- in fact, it should be different *every time we measure it*, since we choose our subgroup randomly each time -- but for many parameters we know that the value we estimate from taking random samples will, on average, be the correct value. Furthermore, thanks to a classic theorem of statistics known as the [*Law of Large Numbers*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), we know that, if our sample is large enough, the variability of our estimate around this average will go down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics is now often used in cases where there isn't an obvious \"large population\" that we \"draw samples from\". For example, our experiment may involve creating a genetic line of mice, measuring properties of every single mouse (often less than 10) and then inferring what the values of those properties would be if we were to keep generating more mice. Because of this, the term \"sample\" has somewhat fallen out of use outside of statistics proper, in favor of the term \"dataset\". However, the classical application of statistics to measuring extant populations of individuals via random sampling has given us the vocabulary that we use to describe our statistical procedures and the intellectual framework that we use to explain and motivate our inferences."

    "In the examples above, we calculated the value of a parameter on a sample in order to estimate its value in a population. This is called a *plug-in* estimator because we just \"plug-in\" our sample to the formula for the parameter. For example, we calculate the maximum of the sample to estimate the maximum of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we needn't always do this. We can, in principle, use any value as an estimate of any other value. We could calculate However, when we infer or estimate parameters, we want our estimator to be good. In this section, we'll try to work out just what we mean by *good*.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of different choices we can make when estimating parameters, let's focus on data that comes from a distribution where the mean and the median are in the same spot. Distributions like these have a \"center\", which is sometimes called the *location parameter*. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we estimate this center with the median or with the mean, the average value of our estimate, averaged over possible samples, is equal to the value of the center. An estimator that has this property is called an *unbiased* estimator. In some cases, an unbiased estimator for a parameter doesn't exist (we'll encounter this later, when we come to estimating model performance). Perhaps more surprisingly, there are often situations where the plug-in estimator is biased, and sitations where a biased estimator is a good choice. We'll be focusing on unbiased estimators for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if we restrict ourselves to unbiased estimators, we can think of estimators other than the sample mean or median. We could, for example, also take a sample, throw out all except the third number, and use that as our estimate for the center. This will also be an unbiased estimator -- averaged over possible samples, the average value of the third number is just the mean, which is the location of the center.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q1 Can you think of some reasons why this is a bad estimator? Hint: will this value be closer to or further from the true value than the sample mean? How do you quantify \"closeness\"?"

    "In this exercise, we'll investigate whether the mean or the median of the sample is a better choice for estimating the center of two populations with different distributions, using this criterion of efficiency.\n",

    "Notice that each time we collect a sample, we get a different answer for the mean and median. This is because the data we collect is different each time. In the classic view of statistics, this is because the sample is drawn at random, and so the mean and median \"inherit\" randomness. That is, because our data varies randomly from experiment to experiment, any number we calculate using our data, any *statistic* we compute, also varies randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means that the statistics that we calculate have a probability distribution, just like our data! The histograms above are estimates of those distributions, just as a histogram for our sample is an estimate of the data's distribution. One of the key goals in the academic discipline of statistics is to characterize the distributions of our statistics, which are called *sampling distributions*, as in *sampling distribution of the mean* and *sampling distribution of the p-value*. If we know how these distributions behave, then we can interpret the statistics we calculate and even design new ones!\n",
    "\n",
    "Shockingly, a wide variety of statistics have a very simple form for their sampling distribution: it is very close to a Gaussian, and the location of its center and width can be estimated from the data. This is the content of the celebrated *Central Limit Theorem*, which states that if the statistic being calculated involves adding up a collection of data values, as in the cases of the mean and the variance, then the sampling distribution of the statistic becomes closer to a Gaussian as the size of the dataset increases. Check out the `Central Limit Theorem Demo` notebook to see some animations of sampling distributions of the sum changing as the sample size increases."

    "Because the outcome of the calculation of a statistic is a random variable subject to a distribution, we can't be certain that the value of the statistic that we compute from our sample is the true value -- in fact, we can often be certain that we're incorrect!\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead of reporting a single value for the statistic, we need to report a range of values, also known as an *interval*. We'd like to choose a range such that it is very likely that this interval contains the true value, but we'd also like the interval to be as small as possible. Unfortunately, we can't guarantee that this interval of values contains the true value -- our interval is, after all, going to be calculated from our sample, so *it is itself a statistic* and therefore *it has a sampling distribution*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we're very clever, we can design our interval such that we know what its sampling distribution looks like -- so that we know what the distribution of intervals would be, were we to collect data for the same experiment many times and calculate the interval each time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Under this distribution, some of the intervals will contain the true value of the parameter, and some of them will not. We can calculate, *a priori*, the fraction of the intervals that do contain the true value. We call this our *level of confidence* in the interval. If, for example, the interval calculated from the data according to some procedure will contain the true value in 80% of the cases, we report that the true value is in that interval with confidence level 80%. Such an interval would be called an *80% confidence interval* for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, it can be shown that, if the sampling distribution of the statistic is Gaussian, then we can construct a 95% confidence interval by setting the bounds to ±1.96 times the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the statistic around the value we calculated from our sample. The phrase *standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the statistic* is a mouthful, so it is often abbreviated to *the standard error of the statistic*, for example *the standard error of the mean*."

    "One part of the cleverness necessary for building tight, valid confidence intervals is in making correct assumptions about the distribution of the data so that we can draw correct conclusions about the sampling distribution of the statistic. Therefore the validity and utility of confidence intervals depend critically on whether our assumptions about our data are true.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below will simulate a statistical procedure where we compute the mean of some Gaussian data, assume that the sampling distribution of the mean is Gaussian and that the population has the same standard deviation as our sample, and produce 95% confidence intervals as described above. Note that the standard error of the mean is equal to the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size.\n",
