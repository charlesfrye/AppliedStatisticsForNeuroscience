    "Certain types of nerve cells have the ability to regenerate a part of the cell that has been amputated. In an early study of this process, measurements were made on the nerves in the spinal cord of rhesus monkeys. Nerves emanating from the left side of the cord were cut, while nerves from the right side were kept intact. During the regeneration process, the amount of creatine phosphate (CP) was measured in the left and right portions of the spinal cord. You are interested in whether CP levels are different between the cut and control sides of the spinal cord. \n",
