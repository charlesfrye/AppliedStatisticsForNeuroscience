In another form of cross-validation, *k-fold* cross-validation, we split the data into *k* pieces and fit separate models to subsets made out of *k-1* pieces. We then take the predictions of each model on its held out piece and use those as our model predictions when calculating $R^2$.\n",

When the size of the chunks in *k*-fold cross-validtion is smaller than the size of the hold-out set in hold-out cross-validation, it is also less biased. If *k* is equal to *n*, the size of the data set, we call this *leave-one-out* cross-validation. It is the most accurate and least biased estimator of $R^2$, but it requires you to fit *n* models. If fitting one model takes a day and you have a dataset size of 10,000 or one million, this is obviously impractical.\n",

    "Where does the bias in cross-validation come from? It comes from the fact that the model is prevented from seeing all of the data. A model fit on more of the data will do a better job, on average, than a model fit on less of the data. Therefore the full model's $R^2$ on the population will, on average, be higher than the $R^2$ on the population of a model fit on a subset of the data.

    "Recall that a statistic is anything we calculate from our data -- the result of applying a function to our data. In this view, the parameters we calculate from model-fitting are themselves statistics: they are random (usually only because our samples are random) and so have a distribution (aka the sampling distribution). The only difference between the model-fit parameters and more traditional statistics, like the mean or the standard deviation, is that the function involved is a lot more complicated!\n",
    "\n",
    "As with any statistic, we'd like to know the sampling distribution of our parameters. If this distribution is tight, then we have reason to believe that we have found a decently correct model of the data, perhaps even the true model. If the distribution is loose, then our model, even if it is accurate, is likely to be incorrect. At the very least, we can say that a model with a tight distribution of its parameters isn't strongly affected by the randomness of the data, and so we call it a *reliable* model. When a model is reliable, we expect to find roughly the same parameter values if we re-sample our data from the population and fit again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the complicatedness of the function we use to generate our parameters from our data (the killer part is the $\\arg\\!\\min$) means there are, in general, not neat formulas or simple distributions, as we had for estimating the sampling distribution of, say, the mean and standard deviation of independent Gaussian variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bootstrapping to the Rescue!\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, there's a method that works to estimate sampling distributions without assuming almost anything about the population distribution. This method is *bootstrapping*. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use bootstrapping to estimate the sampling distribution of the parameters of a model, we first use the data's empirical distribution as an estimate of the true distribution. We then sample from that empirical distribution to approximate sampling from the true distribution. Sampling from an empirical distribution takes the form of sampling, with replacement, from the data. We then fit the model to each sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "The empirical distribution of parameter values obtained by repeatedly fitting the model to bootstrapped samples is taken as an estimate of the true sampling distribution of those parameter values. We can use this distribution to make judgments about the reliability and likely correctness of our model."

    "Accuracy and reliability are closely related. We measure accuracy by fitting the model to data it has never seen before (simulating a sample from the population) and we measure reliability by fitting the model to simulated samples from the population. A reliable model can be either accurate or inaccurate, but an accurate model will almost always be reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliable and accurate models are what we hope for. If multiple models of the same data are both accurate and reliable, the data provides equal evidence for all of them. If we want to pick one, we usually rely on a form of Occam's Razor: the simplest model that is accurate and reliable is the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliable and inaccurate models arise when our model family is too limited to include an accurate model. For example, we could be fitting a linear model to quadratic or parametric nonlinear data. Our fitting procedure consistently finds the same solution when presented with new data, but this solution is not close to the true model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unreliable and inaccurate models arise when there is too much noise or too little data to fit a good model. On the side of reliability, a large ratio of noise to data quantity means that samples are more likely to look different from each other, and so be described by models with different parameters. On the side of accuracy, a large ratio of noise to data means that there's less evidence for the true relationship in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing the number of parameters effectively reduces the amount of data. Increasing the number of parameters too much for the level of noise and the size of the dataset results in models that are unreliable and inaccurate, but nevertheless do a good job describing the data on which they were trained. These models are called *over-fit* models.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is only infrequently the case that a model is both accurate and unreliable. For this to be the case, the full sample used to train the model must be similar enough to the population that fitting uncovers parameters that give a good fit to the population, but re-sampling from the population (e.g. by bootstrapping) results in wildly different models each time. This in general only occurs by chance, not due to deterministic factors, like choice of model family or noise level, as in the other three cases. If the data has outliers, but you don't take this into account in your model, this becomes slightly more likely. "
