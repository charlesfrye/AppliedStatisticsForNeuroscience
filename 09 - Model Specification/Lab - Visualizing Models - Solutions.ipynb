These are called **linear-nonlinear** models, or **LN** models, since they include linear component followed by a nonlinear component. You can make your own if you'd like!

    "Our models so far have been *parametric* models, since they included a limited number of parameters, vectors $w$ or $\\theta$. For the models we've considered so far, this has severely limited the kinds of relationships our functions have been able to capture. The technical way of saying this is that it has limited the *expressivity* of our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to fix this is by attacking it directly: improving the expressivity of the nonlinear functions in our parametric models. We used simple functions, like the trigonometric functions and exponential functions, but these turn out to be bad choices for expressivity. By trial and error, the field of machine learning has stumbled upon *neural networks* as a good choice. In a neural network, multiple linear-nonlinear functions are chained together, one after the other. For reasons that are still under research, this is a fabulous way to get tremendous expressivity out of small numbers of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't spend a ton of time on neural networks in this class, so if you'd like to see those models in action, check out Google's [Neural Network Playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The other way to fix this is by using the dataset as the parameters of the model. That is, we try to come up with a clever function $f(x,D)$, where $D$ is the entire dataset, that does a good job predicting $y$. Because the model depends directly on the data, and not on any parameters, we call these models *non-parametric* models. Non-parametric models are able to model any relationship between variables, but they're usually computationally expensive to fit and to get predictions out of, and they have worse performance on data that is actually generated by a parametric model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This should remind you of the non-parametric statistical methods we've discussed, like the bootstrap. In the bootstrap, the model of our data was the data itself, through its empirical CDF. The empirical CDF, unlike the mean or the variance, gets harder to describe as we get more data: to write down an empirical CDF, you need to know the location of each \"step\" in the function -- of each data point -- while to know the mean or variance you only need one number. Bootstrap models were also more computationally expensive and performed worse on models that came from parametric distributions."

For them, the key property of non-parametric models is that they solve our expressivity problem and, relatedly, don't make strong assumptions about the kinds of relationships that might be in the data. Non-parametric models and neural networks are similar in this regard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though I understand where this perspective is coming from, I think it's somewhat confusing, especially since polynomial models can also be very expressive, especially when they have as many degrees as neural networks have parameters (in the tens, if not hundreds, of thousands!). It's also absolutely the case that neural networks have parameters, so folks find themselves in the awkward position of having a \"non-parametric\" model that has parameters!"

It's a local regression model and can be thought of as a smoother version of nearest-neighbor regression, hence the first, third, and fourth words in its name. At each possible value for $x$, we fit a (possibly linear) regression model to the nearest datapoints, with more emphasis on the datapoints that have the the most similar $x$ values.
