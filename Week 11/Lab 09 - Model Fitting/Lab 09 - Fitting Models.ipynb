Once we've picked a model family (e.g. linear model, linearized/nonlinear model with fixed non-linearities), we can use this as a criterion to pick a particular model out as best: we want the model that assigns the *highest* probability to our data.\n",

Optimization is a general principle of mathematics and science -- many mathematical quantities can be defined as \"optimal choices\" for some problem (including the gradient function, which we'll be using to do some of our optimizations!), and the sciences have made great strides based on the assumption that biological systems evolve to find optimal solutions to problems or that physical systems move to minimize their energy.\n",

    "Why do we do this? One explanation usually given is that \"it makes the algebra easier\". Sums are more familiar than products, after all! Some expositors also note that, on a computer, multiplying lots of small numbers is prone to error, and logarithms mitigate that issue. Another common argument is that, for most optimization problems, we think of \"minimizing a cost\" rather than \"maximizing a reward\" -- finding the shortest distance between two points, reducing expenditures for a business, spending the least energy -- and we want to connect our problem as closely as possible to other optimization problems, so that we can make as much use as possible of other work.\n",
    "\n",
    "I find these explanations to be a little lame. There's a deep reason why we perform this series of transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The negative log probability is also called the *surprise*, and it shows up in fields like information theory and statistical physics, where it's connected to *entropy*, *information*, and *energy*. In this view, by taking the negative log, we've re-written our problem from \"maximize the likelihood\" into \"minimize the total surprise\", which is an equivalent, but more natural, way of thinking about the problem of model fitting.\n",

    "Our goal is to adjust theta to make the cost function as small as possible. For most cost functions, we can achieve this in one of two ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only approach that is guaranteed to work in all cases is to try absolutely every single value of $\\theta$. If we've evaluated all of the models, then we certainly know which one is best! Unfortunately, this assurance is about as valuable as a ticket on a rocketship to Alpha Centauri: you'll be dead before the journey's over, so what's the point? \n",
    "\n",
    "We can usually do a pretty decent job by just trying a random selection of lots of values for $\\theta$. The emphasis here is on lots. As an example, this approach is frequently employed as part of the pipeline in machine learning papers by the likes of Amazon, Google, and Facebook, and the cost to simply run enough computers long enough to check all of these values runs into the hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, there is an alternative that works most of the time! If we know what the derivative of the cost function is, we can follow it towards a (locally) minimum value of the cost function. This is called *gradient descent*.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, we evaluate the derivative of the cost function at the current value of $\\theta$. If $\\theta$ is a vector, then the derivative is a vector that contains the derivative of the cost function with respect to each element of $\\theta$. We call this the *gradient*. The gradient vector points in the direction which makes the cost function go up the most, also known as the *direction of steepest ascent*, which is the opposite of the direction which makes the cost function go down the most, the *direction of steepest descent*. So to make the cost function go down as fast as possible, we multiply the gradient vector by -1 (flipping it around) and take a small step in that direction.\n",

    "To draw a cost surface, we plot the value of the cost function at each combination of values for the inputs. Because we're able to, at most, make things in 3 dimensions, we'll have two input dimensions and leave the third for the cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may seem somewhat mysterious, but it's actually quite straightforward. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the notion of a surface is one way to generalize the familiar old idea of the graph of a function to functions that take more than one input. Read the paragraph above again, but imagine a cost function having only one input dimension. It's describing how to draw the graph of the cost function!\n",

    "Let's visualize some surfaces that are closer to what you might see if you plotted the cost surface for a model you were optimizing. A list of cost functions is defined in the cell below. The cell beneath it will visualize the cost function that is assigned to the variable `cost`. The value of the cost function is indicated with both z-value and color. Darker color indicates a higher cost.\n",
