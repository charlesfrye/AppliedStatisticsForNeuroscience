Some expositors also note that, on a computer, multiplying lots of small numbers is prone to error, and logarithms mitigate that issue. Another common argument is that, for most optimization problems, we think of \"minimizing a cost\" rather than \"maximizing a reward\" -- finding the shortest distance between two points, reducing expenditures for a business, spending the least energy -- and we want to connect our problem as closely as possible to other optimization problems, so that we can make as much use as possible of other work.\n",

    "The negative log probability is also called the *surprise*, and it shows up in fields like information theory and statistical physics, where it's connected to *entropy*, *information*, and *energy*. In this view, by taking the negative log, we've re-written our problem from \"maximize the likelihood\" into \"minimize the total surprise\", which is an equivalent, but more natural, way of thinking about the problem of model fitting.\n",

Try rotating so that you are looking parallel to the model plane and then wiggling the plot. The apparent motion, or parallax, will help.

    "With nonlinear models, the collection of all models in the family no longer defines a plane. Instead, we end up with a curved surface. This means we can't write down an explicit formula and solve for the correct parameters.\n",

    "Let's look again at the equation that expresses the cost-function view of our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to adjust theta to make the cost function as small as possible. For most cost functions, we can achieve this in one of two ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only approach that is guaranteed to work in all cases is to try absolutely every single value of $\\theta$. If we've evaluated all of the models, then we certainly know which one is best! Unfortunately, this assurance is about as valuable as a ticket on a rocketship to Alpha Centauri: you'll be dead before the journey's over, so what's the point? \n",
    "\n",
    "We can usually do a pretty decent job by just trying a random selection of lots of values for $\\theta$. The emphasis here is on lots. As an example, this approach is frequently employed as part of the pipeline in machine learning papers by the likes of Amazon, Google, and Facebook, and the cost to simply run enough computers long enough to check all of these values runs into the hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, there is an alternative that works most of the time! If we know what the derivative of the cost function is, we can follow it towards a (locally) minimum value of the cost function. This is called *gradient descent*.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, we evaluate the derivative of the cost function at the current value of $\\theta$. If $\\theta$ is a vector, then the derivative is a vector that contains the derivative of the cost function with respect to each element of $\\theta$. We call this the *gradient*. The gradient vector points in the direction which makes the cost function go up the most, also known as the *direction of steepest ascent*, which is the opposite of the direction which makes the cost function go down the most, the *direction of steepest descent*. So to make the cost function go down as fast as possible, we multiply the gradient vector by -1 (flipping it around) and take a small step in that direction.\n",

    "This is all a lot easier to understand when you a) visualize the cost surfaces and b) try fitting parameters yourself."

    "This may seem somewhat mysterious, but it's actually quite straightforward. \n",

    "First, the notion of a surface is one way to generalize the familiar old idea of the graph of a function to functions that take more than one input. Read the paragraph above again, but imagine a cost function having only one input dimension. It's describing how to draw the graph of the cost function!\n",
