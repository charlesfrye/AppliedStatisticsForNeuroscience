    "## What is Jupyter?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebooks allow you to combine written text and executable code in a single document. Because these documents are rendered by web browsers, they work on all major operating systems and can include a ton of neat features designed for use on the web, like formatting with HTML, CSS, or [Markdown](#Markdown-cells), media, including static and animated plots and audio, and even mathematical equations via $\\LaTeX$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even better, Jupyter notebooks work with multiple languages. The primary languages appear in the name: \"Jupyter\" is a combination of [Julia](http://julialang.org/) (a younger language aimed at scientific computing), [Python](http://python.org/) (the language of this course), and [R](https://www.r-project.org) (the primary language for statistical computation). Jupyter notebooks support over 40 languages, including such esoterica as [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) (a mathematically pure functional language) and [Forth](http://www.forth.org/) (a language that mostly disintegrated during the second Bush administration).\n",
    "\n",
    "The capacities of Jupyter notebooks are constantly expanding (for example, a project is currently in the works to integrate them with [automatic grading software](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)). Even better, the core team for Jupyter works out of the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu/)!"

    "\n",
    "    jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also do this from any directory above the notebook, you'll just have to navigate down.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you do this, your shell will be occupied with Jupyter, so you'll need to open another shell if you want to continue typing in shell commands. You'll also notice that lots of information is printed to the shell by Jupyter. This information can be safely ignored if you're not debugging Jupyter or running a notebook server (which you're not!).\n",
    "\n",
    "After you are finished with your Jupyter session (and have saved everything), you can close Jupyter by hitting \"`ctrl + C`\" in the terminal/PowerShell window (twice).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you launch Jupyter, you will be presented with a menu of files in your current working directory to choose to edit. After selecting the file you wish to edit, it will appear in a new window in your browser, formatted and ready to edit. You can also create a new file by clicking the \"New\" button at the top right corner of the screen. You can also open files from elsewhere on your computer by clicking \"Upload\".\n",
    "\n",
    "At some points while running a Jupyter notebook, you might need to start over fresh. You can do this by clicking \"Kernel\" in the toolbar and selecting \"Restart\" or by typing in \"`Esc, 00`\", which means \"the escape key, followed by the 0 key twice\"."

    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook consists of **cells**.  The two main types of cells you will use are **code cells** and **markdown cells**, and we will go into their properties in depth momentarily.  First, an overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells are self-contained snippets of text or code. You can add new cells by using the \"Insert\" pulldown menu from the Jupyter toolbar at the top left corner of the screen. You can also cut and paste cells using the appropriate icons in that toolbar or buttons in the pulldown menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "A code cell contains actual code that you want to run.  You can specify a cell as a code cell using the pulldown menu in the toolbar in your Jupyter notebook -- \"Cell\", \"Cell Type ->\", \"Code\".  Otherwise, you can can hit `esc` and then `y` \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to run a code cell, hit \"`shift + enter`\". It's important to note code cells are run in the order that you execute them, rather than the order they are written in. This can cause confusion as you're writing and debugging code in a Jupyter notebook -- just because something is written higher up on the screen doesn't mean it has been run! If you've used the cell feature of MATLAB (`%%` to set off code blocks), then you know the general principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells contain text.  The text is written in **markdown**, a lightweight markup language (markup language being the ML in HTML!).  You can read about its syntax [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). We'll also discuss some of the basic elements [below](#Markdown-cells). If you'd like to see the markdown of this document, you can also \"un-render\" the text cells by double-clicking on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can also insert HTML into markdown cells, and this will be rendered properly. If you'd like to see an example, double-click the header image of this document. Also, as you are typing the contents of these cells, the results appear as text. Hitting \"`shift + enter`\" renders the text in its full formatting. You can specify a cell as being a markdown cell in the Jupyter toolbar.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of keyboard shortcuts that make editing a Jupyter notebook easier. \n",

    "\n",
    "Below, we'll generate a cute animation by first writing a function that does most of the work, then calling it in a later cell. Python gives us the freedom and the power to define these small functions without all the overhead of languages like MATLAB, which helps us reuse code and express our ideas as simply and elegantly as possible. In addition to being a fun mental exercise and an opportunity for a little friendly competition, these kinds of coding practices make our code easier to understand and to fix when something is broken!\n",

    "To make sure that somebody coming along later can use our function without having to read and understand the code, we begin with a \"doc string\" or a brief explanation of what the function does. The formatting used below is standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view the doc string of any function, including the ones you write, by applying the function `help` to your function: `help(functionName)`. We'll do that below for our function."
