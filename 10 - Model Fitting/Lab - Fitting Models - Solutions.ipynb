Some expositors also note that, on a computer, multiplying lots of small numbers is prone to error, and logarithms mitigate that issue. Another common argument is that, for most optimization problems, we think of \"minimizing a cost\" rather than \"maximizing a reward\" -- finding the shortest distance between two points, reducing expenditures for a business, spending the least energy -- and we want to connect our problem as closely as possible to other optimization problems, so that we can make as much use as possible of other work.\n",

    "The negative log probability is also called the *surprise*, and it shows up in fields like information theory and statistical physics, where it's connected to *entropy*, *information*, and *energy*. In this view, by taking the negative log, we've re-written our problem from \"maximize the likelihood\" into \"minimize the total surprise\", which is an equivalent, but more natural, way of thinking about the problem of model fitting.\n",

Unfortunately, this assurance is about as valuable as a ticket on a rocketship to Alpha Centauri: you'll be dead before the journey's over, so what's the point? \n",

As an example, this approach is frequently employed as part of the pipeline in machine learning papers by the likes of Amazon, Google, and Facebook, and the cost to simply run enough computers long enough to check all of these values runs into the hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars.\n",

The gradient vector points in the direction which makes the cost function go up the most, also known as the *direction of steepest ascent*, which is the opposite of the direction which makes the cost function go down the most, the *direction of steepest descent*. So to make the cost function go down as fast as possible, we multiply the gradient vector by -1 (flipping it around) and take a small step in that direction.\n",
